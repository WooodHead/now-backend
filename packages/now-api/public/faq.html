<h3>What is Meetup Now?</h3>
<p>Meetup Now is where people come together to grow together in real life. Everyday, we scroll through our social feeds just skimming the surface of what’s happening in the world. A like here. A comment there. But modern digital interactions are leaving many of us feeling unfulfilled, disconnected and disengaged. That’s why we created Meetup Now: a new community brought together IRL through a series of spontaneous meetups that are based on what’s happening today.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Each night at 9pm, you’ll get invited to an interesting, timely meetup of the day happening in your area the following day. If you’re into it, sign up and go. It’s that easy. Turn your notifications on to hear about the meetup of the day. You can even chat with other people attending beforehand.</p>

<h3>How is Meetup Now different to Meetup?</h3>
<p>Meetups and Meetup Groups are typically based on very specific interests and passions giving members a chance to reconnect with, or go deeper into a variety of areas of interest on any given day. Meetup Now is based on one timely topic curated by the Meetup Now team, each day.</p>

<h3>Who’s it for?</h3>
<p>Curious people with a growth mindset who are unsatisfied with the status quo and eager to explore. People who are not afraid of meeting new people and might be feeling stuck in their routine or social circle. People who have a wide range of interests, who care about what’s happening in the world and are willing to give new things a try. Young professionals living in cities.</p>

Why did I get a text message about Meetup Now at 9pm?
Each night at 9pm, you’ll get invited to an interesting, timely meetup of the day happening in your area the following day.


<h3>Can anyone join?</h3>
<p>Meetup Now is invite only. Every Meetup Now member will be given a chance to invite a friend. When you invite a friend, your friend will receive the following message via your sharing platform of choice. “Hey, I invited you to join tomorrow’s meetup of the day with me! You just have to get the app here: https://now.meetup.com/ and use this invite code. But hurry, if you don’t sign up by 9 p.m. we’ll both lose our spots!” We’re more interested in having the chance to nurture our community as it builds than grow too quickly and miss important steps. </p>

<h3>How many people can I invite to Meetup Now?</h3>
<p>You can invite one friend per daily event. </p>

<h3>Can strangers contact me on Meetup Now?</h3>
<p>No. We have a chat feature where anyone attending the meetup of the day can post a question or comment to the group. Nobody can contact you directly.</p>

<h3>Can I delete my account?</h3>
<p>Yes. When you click on the person icon at the bottom of the screen, you’ll be directed to your account. Under the gear icon, you’ll find a list of settings which includes ‘Delete Account.’</p>

<h3>Does Meetup Now work with advertisers or sell my data?</h3>
<p>No.</p>

<h3>Where does the meetup of the day take place?</h3>
<p>Thanks to our partnership with WeWork, we have access to 60 rooms around the city. You’ll always know where the meetup of the day is by checking the app. Sometimes the topic will call for a different type of venue or location. For example, some may take place outdoors in a park, or on a rooftop.</p>


<h3>Is Meetup Now only in NYC?</h3>
<p>For now, yes. We have plans to scale to other cities in the future.</p>

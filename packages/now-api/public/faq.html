    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What is Meetup Now?</h3>
      <p>Meetup Now is where people come together to grow together IRL. We’re building a new community around spontaneous Meetups that are based on what’s happening in the world around us.</p>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>Each night at 8pm, we’ll announce the Meetup of the Day (always scheduled for the following day). Act fast though! Spots are limited and they go quickly. Our pro tip? Make sure your notifications are on.</p>

      <h3>How is Meetup Now different from Meetup?</h3>
      <p>On Meetup, thousands of groups are run by organizers and based on specific interests and passions. On Meetup Now, only one Meetup of the Day is announced each day based on the trending topic our community cares about the most.</p>

      <h3>Is it for me?</h3>
      <p>If you care about community, meaningful discussion, what’s happening in the world, being socially conscious, and personal growth? Then absolutely!</p>

      <h3>Can I bring a friend?</h3>
      <p>Yes, every time you join a Meetup of the Day you can invite one of your friends. They’ll receive a message from you with an invite code to sign up on the app.</p>

      <h3>Can other members contact me on Meetup Now?</h3>
      <p>No. We have a group chat feature where all members attending the Meetup of the Day can post a question or comment to the group, but no member can contact you individually.</p>

      <h3>Why is the Meetup so small?</h3>
      <p>Because we want to make you feel comfortable. We’ve found that discussing ideas and sharing stories becomes much easier in smaller groups, and we’re all about creating deeper levels of engagement and connection.</p>

      <h3>Does Meetup Now sell my data?</h3>
      <p>No.</p>

      <h3>Where does the Meetup of the Day take place?</h3>
      <p>Thanks to our partnership with WeWork, we have access to rooms, lounges and rooftops designed for connections and conversations, all over the city. The corner bar or cafe is never out of the question though.</p>

      <h3>Is Meetup Now only in NYC?</h3>
      <p>For now, yes, but we plan to scale to other cities in the future. Want us to come you? Recommend your city at <script>email();</script>.</p>

      <h3>I have more questions, how can I contact you?</h3>
      <p>You can contact us at <script>email();</script>. We’re here to help.</p>
